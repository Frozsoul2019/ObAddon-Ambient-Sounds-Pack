## ObAddon Ambient Sounds Pack

This sounds pack contains sound files used in conjunction with ObAddon's ambient sounds module to add ambient sounds to ObAddon maps (currently a work-in-progress).

To use this addon:

1. Download the most current build of ObAddon (https://github.com/caligari87/ObAddon)
2. Enable the ObAddon add-on to Oblige 7.70 (if not already enabled) and restart Oblige as required
3. Select the ZDoom Ambient Sounds module in the Oblige GUI
4. Download this sound pack in default ZIP file format and modify as necessary so that the "SOUNDS" folder appears at the root level (optionally renamed to PK3 extension).
5. Include the final ZIP/PK3 file when launching your Doom game (e.g. using GZDoom launcher)
