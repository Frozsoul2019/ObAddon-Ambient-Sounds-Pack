## ObAddon Ambient Sounds Pack

This sounds pack contains sound files used in conjunction with ObAddon's ambient sounds module to add ambient sounds to ObAddon maps (currently a work-in-progress).

To use this addon:

1. Enable the ObAddon add-on to Oblige 7.70 (see https://github.com/caligari87/ObAddon for further information)
2. Select the ZDoom Ambient Sound module
3. Download and modify the ZIP file (optionally renamed to PK3 extension) as necessary so that the "SOUNDS" folder appears at the root level.
4. Include the final ZIP/PK3 file when launching your Doom game (e.g. using GZDoom launcher)
